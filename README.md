# Steam Comment Extractor
Extract and archive comments from a Steam Community page. 

To use: `python3 steam_comment_extractor.py YOUR_STEAM64ID_HERE`

You can get your Steam64ID from using a website like [this.](https://steamid.xyz/)

Feel free to make issues or contribute but I don't have much interest in working on this beyond the initial version as it has served its purpose. cheers!
